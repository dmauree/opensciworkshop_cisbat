# opensciworkshop_cisbat
Contains the files that are used for the CISBAT 2019 Open Science Workshop

You can find in this repository three files (1 Jupyter Notebook, and 2 Python scripts).
The "data_extractor_7zip.py" script allows you to process a series of file in a specific repository that can be then unzipped while also calculating the average mean values and saving them in another file.

You can find here two scripts (Open Science Workshop.py and Open Science Workshop.ipynb) that can process the anemometer and the meteorological station data from the MoTUS experiment and lets you produce some basic graphs.

There is a Zenodo repository (doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1033386) to find some data from the experiment.
